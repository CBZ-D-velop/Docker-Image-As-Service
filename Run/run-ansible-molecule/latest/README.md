# docker-dind-molecule

## Summary

This Docker image, based on Docker-in-Docker (DinD), is tailored for development and automation tasks, providing an environment with Docker engine and Ansible for orchestration. It includes various essential utilities such as `make`, `git`, `tar`, `unzip`, `bzip2`, `bash`, and others. Python and pip are installed, and the Docker timeout is increased. Additionally, it installs Molecule for testing Ansible roles and collections. The default command (`CMD`) is set to use an entrypoint script to configure Docker client timeout settings.
