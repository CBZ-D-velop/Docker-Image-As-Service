# debian-12-ansible

## Summary

This Docker image, based on Debian, is tailored for development and management tasks, providing a comprehensive set of pre-installed utilities. It ensures a non-interactive system upgrade and installs essential tools such as `rsync`, `curl`, `python3`, `git`, `wget`, `nano`, `htop`, `cron`, `virtualenv`, and more. Python packages are installed via pip, and the system is configured with locales and iptables. The default command (`CMD`) is set to `/sbin/init`, presumably for initializing system services.
