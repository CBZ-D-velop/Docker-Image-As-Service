# debian-11-ansible

## Summary

This Docker image is based on Debian and is designed to provide a platform with various essential utilities pre-installed. It creates a user if not already present, sets up a default working directory, and updates the host system, ensuring non-interactive operation. The image includes tools such as `rsync`, `curl`, `python3`, `git`, `wget`, `nano`, `htop`, `cron`, `virtualenv`, and others for a versatile development and management environment. Additionally, it installs Python packages via pip, sets up locales, and configures iptables. The default command (`CMD`) is set to run `/sbin/init`, presumably for initializing system services.
