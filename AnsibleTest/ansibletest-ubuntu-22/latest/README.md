# ubuntu-22-ansible

## Summary

This Docker image, based on Ubuntu, aims to provide a versatile development and management environment. It sets up a user if not already present and establishes a default working directory. The image ensures a non-interactive system upgrade and installs essential tools such as `rsync`, `curl`, `python3`, `git`, `wget`, `nano`, `htop`, `cron`, `virtualenv`, and more. Additionally, Python packages are installed via pip, locales are configured, and iptables are set up. The default command (`CMD`) is set to run `/sbin/init`, presumably for initializing system services.
