# debian-11-certification

## Summary

This Docker image, based on Debian, aims to provide a versatile development environment. It creates a user and sets up a default working directory. The image ensures a non-interactive system upgrade and installs essential tools such as `rsync`, `curl`, `git`, `python3`, `gnupg2`, `openssl`, `zip`, `bzip2`, `tar`, `unzip`, and `gpg`. Python and pip are also installed and upgraded to the latest version. Additionally, it installs community additions specified in the `requirements.txt` file using pip. The default command (`CMD`) is set to run `/sbin/init`, presumably for initializing system services.
