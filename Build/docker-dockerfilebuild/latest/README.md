# docker-dockerfilebuild

## Summary

This Docker image, based on Docker-in-Docker (DinD), is intended for development and automation tasks. It sets up a user and a default working directory, updates installed packages, and ensures Docker is started and enabled. Essential utilities like `make`, `git`, `bash`, `curl`, `wget`, `zip`, `unzip`, `tar`, and `gzip` are installed to facilitate various development tasks. After installation, package cache is removed to save space. The default command (`CMD`) is set to display the Docker version.
